    "answer": "Goal Setting Process: 1) Timing: Set goals in January/February (aligned with performance cycle) and at start of new role. 2) Framework: Use SMART goals - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. 3) Number: 3-5 major goals per year (too many dilutes focus). 4) Categories: Business/project outcomes (60%), skill development (25%), leadership/collaboration (15%). 5) Draft: Create initial goals, discuss with manager, refine together. 6) Documentation: Enter in performance.company.com by February 28th. 7) Alignment: Goals should support team/department/company objectives. 8) Examples: 'Launch Product X by Q3 with <5% bug rate', 'Complete Python certification by June', 'Mentor 2 junior developers through successful projects'. 9) Mid-Year Review: Revise goals in July if priorities shifted. 10) Tracking: Update progress quarterly in system, discuss in 1-on-1s. 11) Weightage: Can weight goals by importance (e.g., 40% Project A, 30% Project B, 30% Development). Year-end review evaluates against these goals. Pro tip: Include stretch goal (challenging but rewarding).",
